## How to run

For the first two problems you don't need to install any dependencies, however for the third one I did use `feedparser` so make sure to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

For the reverse string I have it accept a string argument and reverse that. If you just run `python reverse_string.py` you will get a help message. You will need to run `python reverse_string.py -s "test string"` or `python reverse_string.py --string "test string` to reverse "test string"
